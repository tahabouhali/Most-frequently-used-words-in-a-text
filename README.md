## Most-frequently-used-words-in-a-text kata for practice TDD implemented in Java by Taha BOUHALI
 * Most frequently used words in a text
 * https://www.codewars.com/kata/51e056fe544cf36c410000fb/
 * Details:
 * Write a function that, given a string of text (possibly with punctuation and line-breaks),
 * returns an array of the top-3 most occurring words, in descending order of the number of occurrences.
 * Assumptions:
 * A word is a string of letters (A to Z) optionally containing one or more apostrophes (') in
 * ASCII. (No need to handle fancy punctuation.)
 * Matches should be case-insensitive, and the words in the result should be lowercased.
 * Ties may be broken arbitrarily.
 * If a text contains fewer than three unique words, then either the top-2 or top-1 words
 * should be returned, or an empty array if a text contains no words.
